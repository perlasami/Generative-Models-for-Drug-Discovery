# 🧬 Generative Models for Drug Discovery
🔬 Project Focus: Accelerating drug discovery using generative models and deep **reinforcement learning**

📘 Project Overview
This project explores the use of generative deep learning for designing novel molecular structures with potential therapeutic properties. Leveraging the vast ZINC database of chemical compounds, the pipeline generates, validates, and optimizes new drug candidates.

The goal is to automate the early stages of drug discovery by generating molecules that are not only chemically valid but also optimized for specific biological or physicochemical properties.

🛠️ Key Technologies and Methods
Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for learning continuous representations of molecules.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for capturing molecular structure and predicting properties.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) for molecular optimization, rewarding desirable properties.

SMILES and molecular graph representations.

RDKit for molecular validation and manipulation.
